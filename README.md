### Inspiration 🦹‍♂️ 🦹‍♀️

> It all begins with a single step. - Team Signature :+1:


* While cleaning up my room, I realised there were a lot of recyclable materials. Questions I asked to myself, why should I recycle if I can simply throw it away ?
* Also tried looking for a centralized recycling facility locator but could not find a suitable one. Therefore this idea was born.
* My procrastination was on its way, when suddenly it struck me, why should I not recycle if **I get a reward in doing so.** and so points are awarded if new recycling facilities are added or items are discarded.

**What FindRecycler does?**  ♻️♻️
 * Providing a proximity search for recycling facilities that are suitable for the appropriate discarded item (say paper, clothes, bags etc).
 * The app also provides a way to crowdsource recycling facilities.
 * Earn rewards based on the recycling activies (discarding items or adding a facility centre). :+1:
